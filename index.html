  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to host a static website, Amazon S3&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">Website Hosting</a> is a very cheap and affordable way. &#8220;Static&#8221; hosting may seem limited, but with Javascript and HTML5 capabilities, you can accomplish quite a bit without a traditional web server.</p>

<p>If you aren&#8217;t familiar with S3, the basic steps are:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a Bucket, which acts as a sort of directory of files,</li>
<li>upload files to your bucket, optionally making them public,</li>
<li>enable Website Hosting, providing an index and error page,</li>
<li>Amazon gives you a domain which serves your Bucket, which you can
then create a CNAME to from any of your domains.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, for very literally pennies a month, you
have 99.99% uptime and 99.99999999% durability on your files, fast
bandwidth, all without a single server or process to worry about.</p>

<p>This can work well for a traditional static site, but what if you&#8217;d like
to have nice, dynamic URLs? Let&#8217;s create a simple example of
bgcolor.com. You want users to be able to specify the desired background
color via the URL. You could use query strings (bgcolor.com/?blue) or hashes (bgcolor.com/#blue) to
pass data to Javascript on your index page, but this isn&#8217;t likely to be
understandable or easy to memorize for the average non-technical person.</p>

<p>Enter S3&#8217;s &#8220;error&#8221; page. The page you specify as your error page will be
served on 404s, and importantly, served at the 404 URL itself. So we can
set both our index and error pages to the same page, and examine the URL
with Javascript to perform the correct routing, loading, or action. For
our bgcolor.com example, we can now allow users to type
bgcolor.com/blue. Let&#8217;s take a look:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">background</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pathname</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And you&#8217;ve got it! Note that this technique doesn&#8217;t mean you lose the
ability to have an actual 404 page; you can have your URL logic be aware of an
invalid URL and update the page appropriately or redirect to a 404.html. Just Google &#8220;javascript url router&#8221; if you don&#8217;t want to write your own, as there are quite a few mature looking ones that already exist.</p>

<p>Enjoy! This is the technique I&#8217;m using to host <a href="http://zazen.rowk.com/">zazen.rowk.com</a>, and it
costs me $0.01/month (yes, one penny).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While there&#8217;s technically a limitation in the DNS specification that
says domain apexes need to be A records, it is often desirable to be
able to point it at another domain, and I wanted to break the common
misconception that this can&#8217;t be accomplished.</p>

<p>The simplest case is that you have a &#8220;naked&#8221; domain such as example.com
that you want to forward to www.example.com. While you can&#8217;t use a CNAME
for your apex, you can indeed accomplish this forward in practice. I
don&#8217;t mean to imply that there&#8217;s a magical way to have a CNAME for
an apex (though with the last AWS method, there kind of is), simply
that what you want to achieve is doable without pointing your apex
directly at application web servers.</p>

<h1>The Easy Way</h1>

<p>If all your want is to have example.com go to www.example.com, there&#8217;s
a free service called <a href="http://wwwizer.com/naked-domain-redirect">wwwizer</a> that does this for you. Simply set your
apex A record to 174.129.25.170. That&#8217;s it! It&#8217;s really that simple!</p>

<h1>The Slightly Harder Way</h1>

<p>You can do what wwwizer is doing yourself, and handle more cases than an
apex going to www, so let&#8217;s look at how that works. If you curl a domain
using <a href="http://wwwizer.com/naked-domain-redirect">wwwizer</a>, you&#8217;ll get an HTTP 301 to www.thatdomain.com. So all that
wwwizer is doing is using the host variable you send it when you request
thatdomain.com, and doing a 301 redirect to www.thatdomain.com.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example nginx server directive that accomplishes this in a
generic fashion:</p>

<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    return 301 http://www.$http_host$request_uri;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want more than a simple apex to www forward, you just need to
create a map of the domains to the desired CNAME, and you are good to
go. You can even still use DNS for this, so you have a single source of
truth, by using <a href="http://webpulp.tv/episodes/learn-how-tropo-built-a-huge-voice-cloud-while-using-dns-for-a-key-value-store">DNS as a key-value store</a>.</p>

<p>All you need to do is point your apex at an IP (or set of IPs) that have
a server configured to perform the appropriate 301s. At this point you
might be complaining that having to maintain a static IP is what you
were trying to avoid, and that&#8217;s fair. But it is important to note that
the A record(s) you use for your apex don&#8217;t have to run your
application, so you can simply throw nginx/apache on a service you
already keep highly available on a static IP (puppetmaster, internal DNS servers, et
cetera). This allows you to use a perhaps more stable and less ephemeral
set of IPs than web server IPs. Plus, multiple domains / applications
can share this server. And remember, if you just need naked ->
www redirection, just use wwwizer instead of worrying about this
yourself.</p>

<h1>The Amazon Way</h1>

<p>If you are using AWS, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/#Zone_apex">they support mapping a zone apex to an Elastic
Load Balancer</a> (ELB) via
their DNS provider Route 53. So this means even as your load balancer is
transparently replaced or scaled up and down, you don&#8217;t have to worry
about the IPs involved.</p>

I&#8217;m rather new to EC2 (and as a result its CloudWatch / Auto Scaling features), so I figured I&#8217;d post about my current thoughts and see if anyone can tell me if I&#8217;m on the right track! I&#8217;m writing everything up as I go, so hopefully it will make a solid blog post for others in the future for going from zero to EC2 + Auto Scaling.<br /><br />Based on my initial research, it looks like the stack will be comprised of:<br /><ul><li>64-bit Maverick AMIs on micro instances, from <a href="http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/10.10/release/">http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/10.10/release/</a></li><li>Puppet for bootstrapping new instances and maintaining existing ones (via the series at <a href="http://ubuntumathiaz.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/using-puppet-in-uecec2-puppet-support-in-ubuntu-images/">http://ubuntumathiaz.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/using-puppet-in-uecec2-puppet-support-in-ubuntu-images/</a>)</li><li>Amazon&#8217;s CloudWatch + Auto Scaling for spinning up/down instances of puppet roles as necessary</li></ul><div>Any yays or nays on this stack? One particular curiosity I had is if Mathiaz&#8217;s guides would be simpler in Maverick, since they were written for Lucid and it seems like each release brings improvements for both EC2/UEC and Puppet. I&#8217;ll also have to figure out how to put some of the roles behind a load balancer, but that&#8217;s for later.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks for any suggestions! Once I&#8217;ve got it all figured out I&#8217;ll put up a somewhat comprehensive guide, unless one already exists that I&#8217;ve missed.</div></div>

While I love my Dell XPS 1330 as an Ubuntu laptop, I&#8217;ve been growing quite tired of my Broadcom wireless card that came in it (I swore it had Intel wifi when I bought it). It requires downloading drivers to work (this can lead to a bit of a bootstrapping problem), and seems to frequently drop connections or have issues connecting.<br /><br />I&#8217;m assuming this is due to Broadcom&#8217;s poor drivers, particularly 64-bit (I remember kernel panics and lack of WPA2 in the not-too-distant past), and was assuming an Intel card would clear my problems right up.<br /><br />Has anyone had problems with Broadcom and fixed them by switching to Intel? If so, could you offer any suggestions as to if I might want the Intel 4965, 5100, or 5300 card?<br /><br />Thanks, dear Ubuntu Planet and other readers!</div>

Thanks for all the feedback! The consensus definitely seems to be that Intel provides a better experience, so I think I&#39;ll grab a 5300.</div>

I have a Intel 5300 and it works absolutely superb. Only tested it with 10.04, but everything works out-of-the-box and reception seems very good. AP mode also worked with no extra setup. Packet injection to &quot;test&quot; WEP encryption will work as well with some patches applied.</div>

Buying a laptop from a Windows-oriented vendor like Dell is always a crapshoot.  The presence of Broadcom wifi is the reason I will not purchase Dell&#39;s otherwise fine Ubuntu machines.  I made sure that my current HP notebook had all Intel hardware when I bought it, but I think I will go with System76 or Zareason next time, if only for personal peace of mind.  Also, it&#39;s nice to get a computer without funding Microsoft.</div>

I can only confirm your suspicion. My last laptop had broadcom 43something. One year a go I suffered lockups and dropped connections.<br /><br />My current laptop has intel 5100 which is pretty much rocksolid. a plus is that 5100 is capable of wirless-N.</div>

The Live CD quite happily loads bcmwl-kernel-source off the CD and installs a functional wireless driver.<br /><br />Yet even now, in Ubuntu 10.04, an installed Ubuntu is unable to find and install the same package. Getting a working Broadcom driver seems to require a wired connection, even though a complete package is present on the CD.</div>

Intel wireless generally works well, but unfortunately it always requires a non-free firmware blob that prevents adding features like AP mode. Fortunately they do have Monitor mode.</div>

I have had nothing but trouble with Broadcom cards - even when they work it seems to me they have poorer reception than Intel equivalents.<br /><br />I yanked the Broadcom that came with my M1330 out quickly and replaced it with an Intel 3945 ABG card and it&#39;s been flawless.<br /><br />I recently got a Studio 14Z which came with a Broadcom G-only card (which was the only option, is this 2006?) and it would work for a bit and then totally crash the closed-source driver.  The STA driver worked a bit better, but replacing it with a 5100 AGN card was what really did the trick.  Worked great.<br /><br />Sadly I had to return the 14Z because Dell&#39;s stupid site doesn&#39;t tell you that you don&#39;t get WWAN antennas unless you pop the extra $50 for custom case color, but I&#39;ll likely get another one soon.</div>

As many of you surely know, Dropbox and Ubuntu One are applications to keep files on your desktop in sync across multiple computers, and backed up in the cloud. After using Dropbox for a year or so on Ubuntu, the Ubuntu One project came out and I thought I&#8217;d move over to it. I assumed it would be easier to set up, being pre-installed, and could integrate better with the file manager and other applications, being made specifically for Ubuntu.<br /><br />After about 6 months of using Ubuntu One, I found it to be too much of a regression compared to Dropbox and switched back. I thought I&#8217;d detail why here for the usefulness of others and to hopefully provide some constructive criticism to the Ubuntu One team which overall is doing good work. So here&#8217;s why I went back to Dropbox:<br /><br /><b>Better Nautilus integration</b><br />The nautilus (file manager) integration in Dropbox feels very mature and polished. Normally I&#8217;d say this is to be expected since Ubuntu One is much younger, but since the nautilus aspect of Dropbox is open-source, there didn&#8217;t seem to be much of an excuse for the Ubuntu One team to not use it as a starting point or at least as inspiration. Whenever I added files to my Ubuntu One folder, no matter how large or how many, they instantly had the checkbox emblem which implies to me they are in sync, even though they couldn&#8217;t possibly be uploaded that quickly. In Dropbox, the files show an animated progress emblem until they are actually uploaded, and show this again when they are being updated. I wasn&#8217;t able to trust the status of files with Ubuntu One, and that wasn&#8217;t a good feeling.<br /><br />Sharing files in Dropbox is also a lot easier via Nautilus, but that deserves it&#8217;s own point.<br /><br /><b>Easier file sharing</b><br />In my typical use cases of file sharing, I want to go from having a file in mind to someone else seeing that file as quickly as possible, be it in an instant message, chatroom (IRC/Jabber), or email to a friend or two. Dropbox makes this a breeze; drag a file into the &#8220;Public&#8221; folder in your Dropbox directory, and right-click on it and select &#8220;Dropbox > Copy Public Link&#8221;. Now you have a publicly accessible link to your file in your clipboard!<br /><br />I never quite figured out how to do this in Ubuntu One; it seems you have to share files with specific people who also are running Ubuntu One (which really compounds the non-cross-platform issue) via the web interface by typing in an email address. This is a cool idea, but seems way over-engineered as a starting point. This was even brought up at the last UDS in an Ubuntu One session but was brushed off; they sadly seemed more interested in engineering complex sharing UIs than getting feedback to ensure they were solving actual problems.<br /><br /><b>Sane notifications</b><br />I think <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/462747">bug 462747</a> is what ultimately drove me to drop Ubuntu One. It notifies you not once but twice for every file you change; once to tell you it is syncing the file and another to tell you it is done. Regarding the first notification, I probably already know that I changed that file; regarding the second, if I&#8217;m really curious about the status of the synchronization, a quick glance at the applet should tell me what I need to know. This was mildly annoying as is, but it does this for hidden files like vim swap files too. Every time I would open or save a file in vim (and I save early and often), I got two notifications about syncing the hidden swap file!<br /><br />Dropbox was much more sane regarding notifications; whenever I would turn on or sit down at a computer, it would show <b>one</b> notification telling me how many files it synced from other machines or, if there was just one changed file, the name of it. Beautiful!<br /><br /><b>Better web UI</b><br />The web user interface for Dropbox felt a lot easier to use, and I often had problems where the Ubuntu One web view would show deleted files or not show files I knew were there that were added days ago. Sometimes I had to collapse and expand a folder a time or two to get it to show the right contents. This led to a similar problem that I mentioned with the nautilus integration; it wasn&#8217;t a UI I could trust to be accurate as was therefore essentially useless. The Dropbox UI was always accurate, and had some nice extras which could prove to be lifesavers like getting past versions of files.<br /><br />I also experienced some other issues including <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/498444">bug 498444</a> which caused Ubuntu One applet to start up with the exclamation icon, giving the impression of not syncing files. If I wanted to edit or view a file that might have changed remotely, I had to manually tell the applet to try syncing again after startup to make sure the file was latest version (or else I could silently end up with .u1conflict file, but that&#8217;s another issue). Additionally, although the transparency is praiseworthy, <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/9498991639">all</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/9331800792">these</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/9292086471">tweets</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/9020860066">about</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/8963442390">recent</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/7755587471">issues</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/UbuntuOne/status/8870678995">downtime</a> do not inspire confidence.<br /><br /><b>That being said</b><br />Ubuntu One does have a few things going for it, however. It is installed by default which means it is the easiest cloud sync/backup solution to get started with for an Ubuntu user. And thanks to CouchDB and a package manager, Ubuntu can ship applications that make it trivial to sync their data with Ubuntu One out of the box. If I can tell all the applications I care about to sync with Ubuntu One (bookmarks, notes, podcasts, basic OS settings/appearance) from one configuration UI, that&#8217;s going to be pretty compelling.<br /><br />While I currently can&#8217;t in good conscience recommend Ubuntu One to a friend (and plenty of my friends don&#8217;t even use Ubuntu), I do have high hopes for the project; it is young and if they can work out some of the above issues, many of them being personal show-stoppers, while providing application and OS integration, Ubuntu One (and perhaps Ubuntu itself) could become too compelling to not use for many people. For now however, Dropbox is the solution which stays out of my way, allows me to solve my problems, and just works.<br /><br />If you are using Ubuntu One or Dropbox, certainly chime in on what the critical features are for you and why you chose one over the other!</div>

I agree with all your points. I had a similar experience, but I used Ubuntu One even less before I got sick of it.<br /><br />My main problem, though, was lack of cross-platform ability. I don&#39;t only use Ubuntu. I don&#39;t even only use Linux. If Canonical ever ported Ubunutu One to Windows and OS X, I might consider using it again.<br /><br />The proprietary nature of Dropbox does bother me, but then again, I have Flash installed, so how bothered can I really be by it?<br /><br /><br />A note: Dropbox does have other notifications, and they are incredibly useful. If a file changes in your Dropbox on another computer, it shows you a notification when the new file has synced to the one you&#39;re currently using. That&#39;s great for me, because sometimes my home computer might be working on a file in my Dropbox through some cron job, or something, but I&#39;ll be at work (on a Mac), and it&#39;s great to have a little Growl notification saying such-and-such file has changed on Home.</div>

I was just checking the web to se if others had the same issues with ububtu one as myself&#8230; and found your post.<br />I probably lost a Lazarus project where the sources were under my ubuntu one folder so that I could easily work from different locations (single user) and have the updated version everywhere.<br />Now I found myself sorting out .conflict files manually to try to rebuild the &quot;latest&quot; version.<br /><br />:/</div>

Hi Nathan! I haven&#39;t tried SugarSync, obviously since there is no Linux version; I use Dropbox to sync 3 Ubuntu computers at the moment :)</div>

Have you tried SugarSync?  I haven&#39;t tried it yet but they seem pretty convincing (see their comparison chart <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/sync_comparison.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>) compared to DropBox.  They&#39;re on everything but Linux so far though :(</div>

I switched from db to u1 because I expected better integration and rather wanted to give my money to canonical. The reliability has steadily improved (I run the daily builds) but all the issues you point out are correct. I have been very disappointed that the service is so inferior to dropbox.</div>

I recently switched to Dropbox as well; my main problem with Ubuntu One were the .conflict files appearing for no valid reason (I was careful to sync before changing between computers, but I always had to double-check and then manually diff the conflict files); that problem is gone since I switched.<br /><br />Lack of symlink support (wishlist #386019) is also a bummer: with Dropbox I don&#39;t have t change the way I work, or where I want my files to be.</div>

I have to say that the cross-platform nature of Dropbox is the major win for me. Much as I&#39;d love to be Linux on all devices, fact is I have Windows, Linux and OS X devices (and an iPhone) and Dropbox just works on all of them. I can&#39;t yet see the point of Ubuntu One.</div>

Free account.  I think with the free account there are limitations on how many revisions are stored, but something like 15 or 30 days worth.  I also do my own backup with a Drobo, but for certain docs which I need regularly the web interface comes in real handy.</div>

It&#39;s been a little while since I&#39;ve used Ubuntu One, but the last time I looked at it you could not revert back to an earlier version of a file or folder the way you can from the Dropbox website.  Is this still the case?  This is a big reason why I&#39;ve not switched from Dropbox yet.  If I mess up a file, or if I accidentally delete it from one machine, I would like the ability to bring it back rather than having those changes propagated to the server and all my other machines as (I think) is currently the case with Ubuntu One.</div>

Dropbox client is also cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, and Android coming soon). Right now this is a huge one for me. I only have two Linux machines synced at this point, but what if I wanted to sync a Windows machine with Ubuntu One I&#39;m out of luck.</div>

So Ubuntu One is a poor Dropbox clone. Shocking. Now imagine if they had decided to open source the server from day one. That would have bought them marketing time to make the product rock, as opposed to the poor Dropbox clone stories that keep running around.</div>

Thanks for the update Stuart, that&#39;s great to hear! I&#39;ll definitely be following the progress of Ubuntu One and as I hopefully implied I won&#39;t be surprised if (and in fact I hope that) one day I&#39;ll switch back.</div>

&quot;I never quite figured out how to do this in Ubuntu One&quot; &#8211; that&#39;s because, right at the moment, you can&#39;t give a file a public URL. This is coming in Lucid &#8211; we&#39;ve been working pretty hard on it since UDS, and it&#39;ll be available with the 10.04 release.</div>

Ah, so you haven&#39;t suffered connectivity problems then!<br /><br />I frequently find myself where the applet has &quot;disconnect&quot; as the menu item, but the folder has &quot;connect&quot; (which does nothing).  It seems that hibernates and suspends confuse the heck out of everything and nothing short of a reboot fixes it.<br /><br />I&#39;ve also had the case where it most definitively is not connected yet somehow claims that the files are all up to date - something that is not true.<br /><br />There was also a problem where it would keep wanting reauthorization which was allegedly fixed in an update a few weeks ago.  (Each of my machines was listed several times as a result.)<br /><br />My view is that Ubuntu One is at best beta quality whereas Dropbox left beta long ago.</div>

Your favorite personal finance application, <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">wxBanker</a>, has turned 0.7!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S29A7hvLBVI/AAAAAAAAAbg/d0PZdNtqyqI/s1600-h/wxBanker-0.7a.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 247px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S29A7hvLBVI/AAAAAAAAAbg/d0PZdNtqyqI/s400/wxBanker-0.7a.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5435634666672162130" /></a><br /><br />This release comes about 2 months after the previous release, and focuses on usability and user experience issues that I obtained from watching people use wxBanker as well as from Launchpad bugs (thanks <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/wxbanker/+bug/496878">Arty</a>!). Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the changes, starting with the account control:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S28ugG2hSQI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/iIskUB1WYi0/s1600-h/wxbanker-6-7-accountctrl.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 129px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S28ugG2hSQI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/iIskUB1WYi0/s400/wxbanker-6-7-accountctrl.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5435614404389456130" /></a><br /><br />On the right we have the new account chooser in 0.7. The main change is using radio buttons for the accounts instead of links. This is a much better, already understood method for choosing accounts, and will also fit in with themes better. The last item is now &#8220;All accounts&#8221; and is selectable, making it easy to get a view of all your transactions and search in them.<br /><br />The &#8220;Hide zero-balance accounts&#8221; option has moved to the View menu, and now has a keyboard shortcut. I&#8217;ve also removed the total number of accounts from the header, as well as the colons after the account names, to reduce clutter. Finally, everything has been given a bit more padding and the buttons have been slightly rearranged.<br /><br />Additionally, the previous graphing library has been replaced by cairoplot (thanks <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/wxbanker/+spec/replaceable-plot-renderers">Karel</a>!), which looks much more attractive. Let&#8217;s check it out:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S286U7l8uqI/AAAAAAAAAbY/ztBe-P27WY4/s1600-h/wxBanker-0.7b.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 247px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S286U7l8uqI/AAAAAAAAAbY/ztBe-P27WY4/s400/wxBanker-0.7b.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5435627406528133794" /></a><br /><br />The Summary view allows you to see a graph of your balance over time, and you can view a graph of a specific account or all accounts by using the account chooser on the left (previously the graph had its own account chooser, that was silly!).<br /><br />And in case you missed the 0.6 announcement, that version brought recurring transactions, XDG directory support, and more intuitive behavior regarding deleting/editing transfer transactions.<br /><br />For downloads and the full list of features and bug-fixes, check out the <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker/0.7/0.7">release page</a>.

I like the message panel idea.  That sounds like a perfect way to do it.</div>

Forest: That seems like a good idea. Can you think of a good way to fit this into the flow without some sort of modal pop-up? What would account creation look like; would this be required or just simpler to do?<br /><br />Maybe using a message panel (as used when creating recurring transactions) to say something like &quot;Your account has been created.&quot; with a button &quot;Add initial balance&quot;, that enables a box an amount field next to it, where you can enter it and it will enter the transaction with date today and description &quot;Initial balance&quot;?</div>
</div>
<div class='comment'>
<div class='author'>Forest</div>
<div class='content'>
Why don&#39;t you just have it query the user for an initial balance every time they create a new account and then automatically create the transaction representing that initial balance?  This is consistent with the way you&#39;re suggesting users use the program, but also more intuitive.</div>

Hi Anonymous! Once you create the account, just add a transaction representing your initial balance via the controls on the bottom, just like you would in any sort of ledger. Then add transactions from there as they occur!<br /><br />Do you have any suggestions for making this more intuitive? I&#39;d love to hear any of your suggestions!</div>

I <a href="http://mrooney.blogspot.com/2009/07/launchpad-is-now-automatic-magical.html">previously wrote</a> about how excited I was for the automated translation import and export features of Launchpad. Launchpad will automatically notice when you commit a translation template and import it, making it available for translation online. Generous translators will then contribute translations, and Launchpad will commit them back to your project.<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer;width: 149px; height: 200px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/S2fxD3QRaNI/AAAAAAAAAbI/AfTFW4D9U7s/s400/thumbsup.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5433576524119894226" /><br />Okay, so this is pretty good! However for this process to work well, the translation template needs to be generated manually by a developer whenever there are changes to strings. Otherwise, translators are working on potentially outdated strings; some are perhaps not in the application anymore, and there are likely some strings which aren&#8217;t in the template yet.<br /><br />After forgetting to generate and commit my template until shortly before a release more than once (and thus having poor translation coverage on newly added strings), I decided to automate this part of the process as well. All it took was a relatively small script to generate the template, and then if there were any changes, commit and push to the branch configured for automatic import in Launchpad. The following script does just that, by searching for any files using gettext calls starting with _(&#8221; or _(&#8216;, and passing them to xgettext.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: bash"><br />#!/bin/bash<br />set -e<br />ack-grep "_\([\"\']" -l | xargs xgettext --output=wxbanker/po/wxbanker.pot<br />ACTUALCHANGES="`bzr diff | grep \"^[\-\+]msg\" | wc -l`"<br />if [[ "$ACTUALCHANGES" != "0" ]]; then<br />  bzr ci -m "automated generation of translation template"<br />  bzr push :parent<br />fi<br /></pre><br /><br />Note that if you aren&#8217;t using Python, you may need to tweak the regular expression supplied to ack-grep. Once the template is generated, the diff is piped through grep to grab any changes to actual messages and make sure there was at least one. Otherwise there would always be changes due to the timestamp in the template, causing useless commits.<br /><br />I then threw this script into a <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> job, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous Integration server</a> I use for <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">wxBanker</a>. I configured this particular job to run nightly, pulling down the latest bzr branch beforehand, and emailing me on any failures.<br /><br />It seems to be working quite well and ensures translators are always translating the latest strings and leaves nothing for me to forget, smoothing out the release process.<br /><br />If this sounds interesting to you but you&#8217;re not familiar with Launchpad as a translation system, check out <a href="http://blog.launchpad.net/general/trying-out-launchpad-translations">http://blog.launchpad.net/general/trying-out-launchpad-translations</a> and feel free to ask any questions here. If you do have experience with translations, how do you handle generating translation templates and then integrating the translations?</div>

I&#8217;ve just released wxBanker 0.5.9 in <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mrooney/+archive/wxbanker-testing">the wxbanker-testing PPA</a>, which is a preview release for 0.6. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with wxBanker already, it is a cross-platform, lightweight personal finance application, and you can find more info at <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">https://launchpad.net/wxbanker</a>.<br /><br />While there are <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker/+milestone/0.6">many improvements and fixes</a> in 0.6, the main feature is recurring transactions, allowing you to automate repetitive transactions. They are functional in 0.5.9 with one caveat and the purpose of this preview release: there&#8217;s no way (besides sqlitebrowser :) to modify existing recurring transactions. As such I&#8217;d love to get feedback on your impressions of recurring transactions, ideas on a nice configuration UI for them, and of course general feedback. With this I can implement the configuration UI and release 0.6.<br /><br />Here&#8217;s an example of a simple quarterly transaction:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcm3zebZLI/AAAAAAAAAX4/Ui32D2TBg88/s1600-h/wxbanker-recurring-simple.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 72px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcm3zebZLI/AAAAAAAAAX4/Ui32D2TBg88/s400/wxbanker-recurring-simple.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383814619697210546" /></a><br /><br />and here is a more complex one, with specific days chosen, as well as the transaction being a transfer from another account:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcl91BFwWI/AAAAAAAAAXw/ANaBFZ7W9PI/s1600-h/wxbanker-recurring.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 108px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcl91BFwWI/AAAAAAAAAXw/ANaBFZ7W9PI/s400/wxbanker-recurring.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383813623678615906" /></a><br /><br />When you start up wxBanker and there is a recurring transaction due, you will see something like:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SrcqtaCE55I/AAAAAAAAAYI/FsSU097v09M/s1600-h/Screenshot-wxBanker-1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 39px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SrcqtaCE55I/AAAAAAAAAYI/FsSU097v09M/s400/Screenshot-wxBanker-1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383818839115229074" /></a><br /><br />I didn&#8217;t reinvent recurrence rules but instead (luckily) found the dateutil module for python which includes rrule, an &#8220;implementation of the recurrence rules documented in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">iCalendar RFC</a>&#8221;, so it should behave quite well.<br /><br />As far as the needed configuration UI goes, there are a couple ideas that I&#8217;ve had so far. Below is the current top-left portion of the UI, for reference:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srco-UL023I/AAAAAAAAAYA/MvdtcqO5lwc/s1600-h/wxbanker-topleft.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 91px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srco-UL023I/AAAAAAAAAYA/MvdtcqO5lwc/s400/wxbanker-topleft.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383816930580028274" /></a><br /><br />One idea was to have a third &#8220;Recurring Transactions&#8221; tab after the &#8220;Transactions&#8221; and &#8220;Summary&#8221; tabs, which appears if and only if recurring transactions exist. This would provide a list of recurring transactions and allow editing them via the same UI used for creation, as well as changing the account or removing them altogether. A second idea is to add another button next to the Add/Rename/Remove account buttons in the upper-left, for account configuration (this will be necessary for future features anyway), and allow modifying recurring transactions for that account there.<br /><br />Another perhaps complementary way would be to provide a right-click action on existing transactions which were recurred, for editing. I&#8217;d also like to implement functionality similar to Google Calendar where editing a value on an existing transaction caused by a recurring transaction will ask you if you want to apply that change to just this transaction, all existing, or all future.<br /><br />If you have ideas, please feel free to leave comments here or drop by #wxbanker on irc.freenode.net any time this week after 10AM PDT, to have a more interactive chat about them. <br /><br />Please do let me know what you think from either just the screenshots here or actually playing around with the application!</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I&#8217;ve been using Launchpad to host my personal finance application <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">wxBanker</a> for a few years now. The thing I was hearing most often was that it wasn&#8217;t localized; people wanted currencies to look the way they should in their country, and the application to be in their language. Let me explain how Launchpad helped me provide translations for my application, and how much of an utterly slothful breeze it has recently become.<br /><br /><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 148px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SnKYTL6ff1I/AAAAAAAAAT0/DHLdJZYT5nM/s320/slothful.png" border="0" alt="Image courtesy of shirt.woot.com" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364517561534742354" /><br />Normally to handle translations, an application has to wrap strings with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext">gettext</a>, create a template, find translators and give the template to them, collect translation files back, and integrate them into the project. This is painful and is why many applications aren&#8217;t localized, and shut out most of the world as a result. One of the amazing features of Launchpad however, happens to be Rosetta, which brings translators TO your translations via a simple web interface, and then makes those translations available to the developer. With Rosetta, translators don&#8217;t need to understand gettext or translation file formats; they just need to know two languages!<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SnKLUdixHfI/AAAAAAAAATs/z36K46Y4p3M/s1600-h/ss_rosetta.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 201px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SnKLUdixHfI/AAAAAAAAATs/z36K46Y4p3M/s400/ss_rosetta.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364503289795780082" /></a><br /><br />So that&#8217;s what a translator sees. Notice how Launchpad even shows how other applications translated the same string. So once you generate a template and upload it, you can assign a translation group to your project such as &#8220;Ubuntu Translators&#8221; so that your strings will be translated by volunteers on the Ubuntu project; if your project isn&#8217;t relevant to the Ubuntu project, you can use the more generic Launchpad Translators group. Now all you have to do is wait for some translations, then download them and check it in to your code. Not too bad, right?<br /><br />It isn&#8217;t, but Launchpad has recently made it so much better. They started by adding an option to <a href="https://help.launchpad.net/Translations/ImportingFromBazaarBranches">automatically import translation templates</a> from your project. This means as you are developing, all you have to do is regenerate the template and commit, and new strings will show up for translators in Rosetta and be translated automatically (from the developer&#8217;s perspective). Then today, <a href="http://blog.launchpad.net/general/exporting-translations-to-a-bazaar-branch">they announced the other side of this</a>, which is automatically committing those translations back into your code on a daily basis. This means that all I have to do is commit templates as I change strings, and Launchpad handles everything else. This is a profound tool for developers.<br /><br />What&#8217;s the next step? Well, from a developer&#8217;s perspective the translation template is a tool to give to the translators or in this case Launchpad. In the future Launchpad could eliminate this by generating the template itself from the code (this is what developers are doing themselves, after all), so that truly all you have to do after you set up the initial i18n/l10n framework is commit code as normal, and Launchpad magically commits back translations.<br /><br />All this work Launchpad is doing gives developers more time to develop while still having localized applications at a very minimal cost. This is continuous translation integration, and boy is it cool!</div>

Hi Michael.<br /><br />Rosetta has gone a long way, and it is a much appreciated tool. However, as a professional translator that sometimes collaborates on free software translations, I must say it is *not yet* a perfect tool. It lacks better concordance support with easier searches, for instance.<br /> I would like to point out that for translating, one needs to know a bit more than just two languages. It is necessary to have a whole lotta of things in mind, and use your brainz in a very complex way :) Whether I do not want to discourage any contributors, l18n is serious business; terminology consistency, some linguistic common sense (and even style) should be stressed. In the business world, bad translations leave bad impressions on your clients. In GNUlinux realmz, where there are quite a few different desktop managers, so many programs and sometimes different names for similar things, bad translations may end up confusing people (esp. newcomers) and eventually turning them, at least, nervous. English prevails largely on the GNULinux world, and the more languages AND the better quality of translations, the closer we will get to squash bug nº1.<br /><br />We will keep on working on it. Cheers!</div>

Thanks for the comment Jeroen! I mentioned Ubuntu Translators because my package is in Ubuntu and it seemed most relevant to readers of my blog on the Ubuntu planet, but mentioning LP Translators for generic use is good to know as well.<br /><br />The problems with automatic translation are definitely true, and it will be interesting to see if any of them can be mitigated. Perhaps allowing someone to import all translations with known good copyrights for untranslated strings, marking them as &quot;Needs Review&quot;.</div>

Hi, I&#39;m one of the Launchpad Translations developers.  Glad you like the new stuff we built!<br /><br />A very minor point: if you want to invite translations for your project, we now have a Launchpad translation group as well as the Ubuntu translation group.  The Ubuntu group is to focus more on Ubuntu (surprise), whereas the Launchpad group can serve as the &quot;generical&quot; translation group for other projects.<br /><br />And a comment on the &quot;automatically use translations from elsewhere&quot; idea: it&#39;s very tempting, but there are a few obstacles.<br /><br />First, there may be a copyright risk from automatically copying other projects&#39; translations.  And once we automatically start avoiding some translations, there&#39;s a bigger risk of choosing bad translations.<br /><br />Second, not every translation you find will be correct, let alone consistent.  Sometimes people import entire translations to the wrong language!<br /><br />So ideally there should still be a human review step for those suggestions before they definitely go into a project.  And that&#39;s exactly how it works now.  For some programs, the &quot;global suggestions&quot; from other projects let you do a large chunk of the work very quickly, even in languages you only just well enough to see which translations make sense.</div>

Tom, I&#39;m not a Launchpad developer, but I have talk of it before I think.<br /><br />I checked out transifex and it seems pretty interesting. I know LP has done work in the past to make Rosetta easier to use for upstreams and sync the two, and I am sure it will only get easier and better.</div>

I love the &quot;Automatically use suggestions for otherwise untranslated strings&quot; option, will it come? Launchpad should get a big language model like Google Wave that would certainly help. Maybe Mark should hire some cheap Google engineers ;)<br /><br />It would be cool if Rosetta could work directly with upstream as http://transifex.org/ can. That also would be a cool addition for people who prefer git etc.</div>

Thanks simpsus :) The tagging branch is waiting on some work from the author, as well as some conceptual work I need to do (how can tagging be hidden/out of the way for users who don&#39;t need that, but easy to discover and turn on?) I&#39;d like to get 0.6 by the end of August with recurring transactions and perhaps reporting (https://launchpad.net/wxbanker/+milestone/0.6), and target tagging/categories for 0.7 not much later.</div>

Tom, that could be cool and I wouldn&#39;t mind an &quot;Automatically use suggestions for otherwise untranslated strings&quot; checkbox, but there are going to be a bunch of previously untranslated strings that will still need translation by a person. And for short phrases there can be multiple translations. For example, the word &quot;read&quot; in English can be both a verb and an adjective, and &quot;import&quot; can be a verb and noun. In another language there might be two different words for each use though, and only a person with context (provided by translation comments) can know which one to use. Certainly though, it seems like it could help you grab some low-hanging translation fruit that&#39;s better than nothing.<br /><br />As far as your second question, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;hosted&quot;. If the project isn&#39;t registered on Launchpad at all, it can&#39;t use Launchpad features obviously. But there is nothing stopping a project hosted anywhere from creating a Launchpad account and using it for Rosetta. If the code is hosted elsewhere (and Launchpad allows you to specify external SCMs and bug trackers, as well as import from them) you could still have a branch in Launchpad solely for Launchpad to import and export from, and handle merges back and forth on your end yourself.</div>

Hi Michael,<br />nice to see you give wxBanker some publicity. Are there any news when the transactions tagging and advanced categories will be merged? When is the 0.6 release planned? <br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Simpsus</div>

Couldn&#39;t it automatically translate without users? Just take the most used strings from other apps?<br /><br />And how about projects that are not hosted on LP?</div>

Often when I am writing in Python, I find that I want to see how long a particular function call or set of statements are taking to execute.  Let&#8217;s say I have the following code that gets executed frequently:<br /><pre><br />for i in range(10000000):<br />   x = 934.12 ** 32.61 * i / 453.12 ** 0.23<br /></pre><br />and I want to know how long it takes to execute to see if it is slowing down my app and should be optimized. Previously I would surround it as such:<br /><pre><br />import time; x = time.time()<br />for i in range(10000000):<br />   x = 934.12 ** 32.61 * i / 453.12 ** 0.23<br />print time.time() - x<br /></pre><br />This will print out the duration in seconds of that code segment, but is more work and typing than I want, and more cleaning up later. I realized that the new &#8220;with&#8221; statement in Python could probably help me out. Let&#8217;s create a little timer class that cooperates with it:<br /><pre><br />class Timer():<br />   def __enter__(self): self.start = time.time()<br />   def __exit__(self, *args): print time.time() - self.start<br /></pre><br />Now all we have to do is:<br /><pre><br />with Timer():<br />   for i in range(1000000):<br />       x = 934.12 ** 32.61 * i / 453.12 ** 0.23<br /></pre><br />You can also try:<br /><pre><br />with Timer():<br />   time.sleep(1.5)<br /></pre><br /><br />For these, 0.28738 and 1.50169 are what I get, respectively. While something like this couldn&#8217;t really replace application-wide profiling via <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html">a module like cProfile</a>, it can be an extremely useful and quick way to see if your prototype is scalable or not. I usually end up having a debug.py or helpers.py file in my larger projects with little tools like this, and I&#8217;ll probably end up adding this one as well.<br /><br />Let me know if you are doing something similar, or if I&#8217;ve reinvented something that already exists. I&#8217;d also love to hear from people profiling their python code and what techniques they are using, as I am just starting to learn about it.</div>

Using the with statement for this is a brilliant idea!<br /><br />Check out <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/profilehooks" rel="nofollow">profilehooks</a> on PyPI for something like this at function level, implemented using decorators.  I wonder how difficult it would be to have the same object (or function) act both as a decorator and as a context manager.<br /><br />Timeit is a great module, but it serves a different purpose: very accurate microbenchmarks.  Sometimes you just need to know whether a for loop takes 1 or 20 seconds; repeating that for loop 1000 times to get its accurate speed up to the nearest microsecond is overkill.  Plus, timeit&#39;s API is cumbersome and inconvenient, or at least I can never remember offhand how to use it, which is the same thing in my book.</div>

&#8230; The timeit module documentation states that it stops you repeating some common errors when doing this kind of task.</div>

Thanks liw.fi for pointing that out, I wasn&#39;t aware of it! However while convenient, I don&#39;t think it is as trivially injectable into existing code paths. It looks great for testing a function or one-liner, but not for a random segment of code that might be a part of a large function / sequence.</div>
