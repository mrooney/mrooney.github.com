<a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">wxBanker</a>, your (hopefully) favorite lightweight personal finance application, has recently been accepted into Jaunty! Aren&#8217;t familiar with it? Check out the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/wxBanker">screenshots</a>! It took a few months of getting over the debian packaging learning curve, and about as much work getting and responding to the reviews from MOTUs, but I did it. I plan on doing a quick point release this week and releasing wxBanker 0.4.0.3, which will sport updated <a href="https://translations.edge.launchpad.net/wxbanker/trunk/+pots/wxbanker">translations in 15 languages</a> (thanks translators!) as well as a minor bug fix or three. Once I get that out and into Jaunty, I&#8217;ll turn my complete focus (I hope) to the 0.5 series. If you&#8217;d like to translate wxBanker to your own language or improve a few of the lacking existing translations (Bosnian, Dutch, and Portuguese particularly), I&#8217;d love it! Head over to <span><a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Ewxbanker-translators">https://launchpad.net/~wxbanker-translators</a> and join the fun!</span><br /><br />The 0.5 series is a refactor and a bit of a painful one, as I didn&#8217;t have a great handle on how to efficiently and smoothly refactor. I could probably do a much better job managing it now, but that&#8217;s how experience works. All in all it is a much cleaner structure and led to more and better tests, which should allow more agile development and protect against future regressions. Some of the main upcoming features I&#8217;d like to get in are transaction tagging, recurring transactions, reporting, online syncing (via mint.com), and csv imports. I&#8217;d love for at least a few of those to make it into 0.5, and there is good progress on some of them including csv imports thanks to <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/%7Ekolmis/wxbanker/csvimport">an impressive branch from Karel</a>. On the other hand 0.5 has already been ongoing for about 3 months and I might cut a release into a PPA and get feedback while I add new features, sorting out any 0.5 issues and leading to a robust 0.6 release.<br /><br />Overall I have learned a TON from this project, in no small part thanks to Launchpad. wxBanker started out as a terminal application which stored everything in a pickled linked tuple that I used for myself and added features as I needed them. Eventually I added a GUI (in wxPython) and registered the project on Launchpad, to get free hosted version control as well as more formal bug tracking (instead of a text file :). The combination of Launchpad and [wx]Python being cross-platform made it accessible to everyone, and took it from a project used only by myself to a project available in 15 languages with code contributions from multiple people.<br /><br />So in conclusion, thanks everyone, enjoy wxBanker 0.4.0.3 in Jaunty, and look forward to future versions in my PPA. If you&#8217;re not on Jaunty yet, you can <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Emrooney/+archive/ppa">install 0.4 from my PPA</a>, which I&#8217;ll be updating to 0.4.0.3 as soon as I release it. I&#8217;d love for any of your contributions, suggestions, questions, or criticisms to end up <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">on Launchpad</a>. I&#8217;d love to make it as usable and intuitive as possible, so anything that is unclear or confusing would be awesome to hear.</div>

I completely agree - having used a bunch of personal management tools I would love to have the power of wxBanker for my personal finances if only for the easy upload.

David: Glad to hear it! I just updated the PPA so you can grab 0.4.0.4 in Intrepid or Jaunty. If you are patching any bugs, 0.4 is a good place, and I will port them forward. Otherwise for new features, 0.5 is a good place for the work.<BR/><BR/>There is no need to wait though; that code should be released soon and I&#8217;d love more testers so feel free to do a &#8220;bzr branch lp:wxbanker/0.5&#8221; and run from there, filing any bugs on launchpad and adding any cool features!</div>

Good to hear you&#8217;ve been working on it. Been keeping an eye on it over the past months, and hadn&#8217;t noticed any new releases. I&#8217;ve been putting off sorting out my personal finances for way too long, so tonight&#8217;s the night :-) Will send some patches your way if I come up with any improvements, but maybe I should wait for 0.5 if it&#8217;s undergoing a major change in codebase?</div>

It is definitely in my plans to get wxBanker into Debian as well, and Ubuntu prefers it as well. I am not sure of the process involved but I will probably take a look at it after I release 0.4.0.3. I am glad it interests you!<BR/><BR/>It is a fairly simple package, you could probably download the deb and use it fine in Debian, or just download the source and &#8220;python setup.py install&#8221; yourself :)</div>

Can you add that to Debian too? Please don&#8217;t leave Debian users out in the cold yet again Ubuntu!</div>
