In December of 2011 I quit my full-time job to pursue other things, so
to encourage myself to evaluate my progress and make improvements, I'm
writing this post. Hopefully it might be useful or interesting to you
too!

Why?
====
In order to know if I've done well, it seems useful to recall my initial
goals. While my non-compatibility with the company structure and
requirements were the ultimate catalysts for quitting, there were a few
lifestyle desires I wasn't fulfilling: I wanted to work less, and have more time to cook,
exercise, and engage my Zen practice. Here are the numbers between then
and now:

* hours worked/week: 40-50 => 20
* meals cooked/day: ~0.7 => 2+
* daily Zen practice (zazen): 15 minutes => 70 minutes
* weekly climbing / yoga: 0 => 2
* bicycling: unchanged at 20-30 miles/week


So, overall I'm quite happy with the time I've been able to set aside
for my interests, and feel healthier in body and mind!

How?
====
As I started this adventure, I re-read __The 4-Hour Workweek__ by
Timothy Ferriss, which I had read initially a few years and applied just
a few of the strategies with great success, primarily a permanent and
major
information diet (kicking Google Reader alone, I gained hours every week,
plus the ability to concentrate again), and empowering others to remove myself as a bottleneck
at the workplace.

The second time through was very inspiring, and I decided to take his
advice and actually create a short 3-month budget, including not only my
standard living expenses (rent, utilities, food, entertainment), but
also any dreams and goals I wanted to accomplish, some costing money,
but others costing time that I didn't have available until now. The
rationale for doing this is profound and twofold: it forces you to actually spend time
figuring out your goals, and then hold yourself accountable for
accomplishing them, and it likely shows you that it isn't as expensive
as you thought.

I've already used this "dreamlining" technique to knock out a few things
I'd long had on my to-do list including:

* taking an aerial acrobatics class
* acquiring a chef's knife and learning basic knife skills
* learning how to raise hens for eggs and meat
* beginning to learn Polish (I live in Greenpoint)

Even with things on my list including skydiving, renting a private
island, and various other travel, this exercise pointed out that I
easily afford them working 20 hours per week. This is possible because 1)
they cost less than you think ammortized over 3-6 months and 2) you can
make a lot more per hour freelancing.



What's next?
============

Working part-time has been incredibly enjoyable, particularly having
entire days off to be out and about during the least-crowded times
(weekday afternoons)
instead of the busiest and most expensive (weekends). Looking at my
budget, I should actually be fine working only 10-15 hours per week,
while still saving a reasonable amount per month and allowing for a
    whopping 10 weeks of vacation per year.
