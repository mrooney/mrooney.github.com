In my [previous](/blog/2012/07/01/freelancing-a-6-month-retrospective/) post I covered in detail my first 6 months of freelancing, and again for the purposes of a personal and business retrospective, I'm going to examine my last 3 months (July-Sept).

What Worked?
============
As far as contracts went, the last three months were busy, including 4
different contracts! The financials are very validating: in this
quarter, after subtracting health insurance costs, I earned 44% more than one quarter of my previous salary (both numbers pre-tax) and worked less than half the time, at an average of 19 hours per week! I've also been heavily using [FreshBooks](https://mikerooney.freshbooks.com/refer/www) (disclaimer: referral link), as it makes tracking hours and sending invoices a breeze, its homepage provides a great business dashboard of unbilled hours, project progress, and outstanding invoices, and it also provides nice reports that I used to quickly find the 44% 19 hour numbers, including the important Profit & Loss statement necessary at tax time.


What Didn't Work?
=================
While that's wonderful, there were a few mistakes I made and promises I
haven't kept to myself. First, I ended up on a project that was very
remniscent of an early stage startup, and expected work on nights and
weekends on tight deadlines with various scalability issues. While it
was challenging and educational, and at times fun, overall it wasn't a
good fit for me or the client as it didn't let me define my own schedule and hours. Along with being my most stressful client, it was also the lowest-paying, so allocating time to other contracts instead was a no-brainer. In the future I'll attempt to notice when deadlines and unknowns (such as working in an existing codebase, or scalability requirements without load testing results) create the risk of time requirements that make me a bad fit for the client. There are plenty of developers excited about working in a full-time start-up environment, and they'd make the client much happier. I'll keep looking for projects that let me set the timeline, don't require frequent meetings/calls, and aren't damaged by minor slippage.

Three months ago, I said I'd take a break when I had more than 3 months
of business runway in the bank. However, at the end of September I had
about 6 months of runway, and I've got a full (part-time) month planned for October. Why? I'm not sure! I assume I continued to take on work partly out of habit, partly because I'm generally enjoying the work, and partly because it seemed good to take on good projects when 

What's Changing?
================
Things to cover:
* very profitable 3 months: 44% more (both figures pre-tax) than 1/4
  annual salary, working half the time (19hrs)
* have I been working more than I wanted? Lessons learned from
  ReactLabs: when part-time, avoid "start-up" like clients that have
  tight deadlines, want nights and weekends work as this removes the
  flexibility to design your own schedule (esp. for calls/meetings/urgent emails) and causes stress on both sides. Best projects for me are ones where I define the schedule and due dates and slippage is okay when caused by either party.
* I haven't stopped working like I said I would when I have 3 months in
  the bank. Why? 
* formalization of schedule. I'll probably formally take Monday and
  Wednesday completely off, and work 3 6-hour days, as I don't mind
  working more than 4 hours.
* plan to form S Corp due to perceived significant tax savings.
