I wouldn't normally have participated in the nearest book meme going around on Planet Ubuntu, except that sentence 5 of page 56 of the nearest book happened to be divine! From Alan Watts' "The Way of Zen":<br /><blockquote><br />Suffering alone exists, none who suffer;<br />The deed there is, but no doer thereof;<br />Nirvana is, but no one seeking it;<br />The Path there is, but none who travel it.</blockquote><br />It happened to stumble perfectly on the closing quote of that particular paragraph! If you want to participate:<br /><ol><li>Grab the nearest book.</li><li>Open it to page 56.</li><li>Find the fifth sentence.</li><li>Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.</li><li>Donâ€™t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.</li></ol></div>

hey! the same thing happened to me just now, after reading the same "find the book nearest to you" message on facebook. i picked up "the Way of Zen" by Alan Watts.  at first i read the fifth line... "ghosts as realities. ... ideals, our.." But i realised that i was to read the fith sentence.  That summary of Buddha's doctrine is really interesting to stumble upon by chance like that :) and out of about 300 books, that was the closest.. Kool</div>
