I've just released wxBanker 0.5.9 in <a href="https://launchpad.net/~mrooney/+archive/wxbanker-testing">the wxbanker-testing PPA</a>, which is a preview release for 0.6. If you aren't familiar with wxBanker already, it is a cross-platform, lightweight personal finance application, and you can find more info at <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker">https://launchpad.net/wxbanker</a>.<br /><br />While there are <a href="https://launchpad.net/wxbanker/+milestone/0.6">many improvements and fixes</a> in 0.6, the main feature is recurring transactions, allowing you to automate repetitive transactions. They are functional in 0.5.9 with one caveat and the purpose of this preview release: there's no way (besides sqlitebrowser :) to modify existing recurring transactions. As such I'd love to get feedback on your impressions of recurring transactions, ideas on a nice configuration UI for them, and of course general feedback. With this I can implement the configuration UI and release 0.6.<br /><br />Here's an example of a simple quarterly transaction:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcm3zebZLI/AAAAAAAAAX4/Ui32D2TBg88/s1600-h/wxbanker-recurring-simple.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 72px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcm3zebZLI/AAAAAAAAAX4/Ui32D2TBg88/s400/wxbanker-recurring-simple.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383814619697210546" /></a><br /><br />and here is a more complex one, with specific days chosen, as well as the transaction being a transfer from another account:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcl91BFwWI/AAAAAAAAAXw/ANaBFZ7W9PI/s1600-h/wxbanker-recurring.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 108px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srcl91BFwWI/AAAAAAAAAXw/ANaBFZ7W9PI/s400/wxbanker-recurring.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383813623678615906" /></a><br /><br />When you start up wxBanker and there is a recurring transaction due, you will see something like:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SrcqtaCE55I/AAAAAAAAAYI/FsSU097v09M/s1600-h/Screenshot-wxBanker-1.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 39px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/SrcqtaCE55I/AAAAAAAAAYI/FsSU097v09M/s400/Screenshot-wxBanker-1.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383818839115229074" /></a><br /><br />I didn't reinvent recurrence rules but instead (luckily) found the dateutil module for python which includes rrule, an "implementation of the recurrence rules documented in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">iCalendar RFC</a>", so it should behave quite well.<br /><br />As far as the needed configuration UI goes, there are a couple ideas that I've had so far. Below is the current top-left portion of the UI, for reference:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srco-UL023I/AAAAAAAAAYA/MvdtcqO5lwc/s1600-h/wxbanker-topleft.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 91px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HU7L5oFDSeA/Srco-UL023I/AAAAAAAAAYA/MvdtcqO5lwc/s400/wxbanker-topleft.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5383816930580028274" /></a><br /><br />One idea was to have a third "Recurring Transactions" tab after the "Transactions" and "Summary" tabs, which appears if and only if recurring transactions exist. This would provide a list of recurring transactions and allow editing them via the same UI used for creation, as well as changing the account or removing them altogether. A second idea is to add another button next to the Add/Rename/Remove account buttons in the upper-left, for account configuration (this will be necessary for future features anyway), and allow modifying recurring transactions for that account there.<br /><br />Another perhaps complementary way would be to provide a right-click action on existing transactions which were recurred, for editing. I'd also like to implement functionality similar to Google Calendar where editing a value on an existing transaction caused by a recurring transaction will ask you if you want to apply that change to just this transaction, all existing, or all future.<br /><br />If you have ideas, please feel free to leave comments here or drop by #wxbanker on irc.freenode.net any time this week after 10AM PDT, to have a more interactive chat about them. <br /><br />Please do let me know what you think from either just the screenshots here or actually playing around with the application!</div>
