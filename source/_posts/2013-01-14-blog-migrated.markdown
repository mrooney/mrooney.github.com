Hey everyone! I just wanted to post a quick mention that I've now migrated my blog to [http://mikerooney.rowk.com/](http://mikerooney.rowk.com), so if you are following this blog, please do update your feed so you continue to get new posts (and check out recent posts over there, as there have been a bunch).

I decided to migrate from Octopress to Wordpress (everyone seems to go
the other way, I know) for a myriad of reasons. I plan to write up why
in a short post over at that blog, so if you'd like to find out,
please subscribe and stay tuned!

In the meantime, if it can help anybody do the same, I migrated my posts
(sort of, they still link here which is fine as that's where the
comments are) from Octopress to Wordpress via the [FeedWordPress](http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/) plugin, which allows you to import from essentially any type of feed.
