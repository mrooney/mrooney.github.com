Today <a href="http://eng.genius.com/blog/2009/04/13/rfc2142-deliverability/">Franck Martin wrote an interesting post</a> regarding <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2142">RFC 2142</a> ("Mailbox names for common services, roles and functions") and how it relates to email deliverability. If you are running your own email server or own a domain, you may interested in reading it as it sums up what email addresses are expected to be manned at any domain and for what purposes.<br /><br />For example, did you know that "if an Internet service providerâ€™s domain name is COMPANY.COM, then the ABUSE@COMPANY.COM address must be valid and supported"? And are you manning your postmaster and hostmaster addresses?</div>
