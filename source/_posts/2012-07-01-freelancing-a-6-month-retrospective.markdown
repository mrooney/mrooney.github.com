At the end of 2011 I quit my full-time job to persue a different lifestyle. In order to evaluate my progress and make improvements, I'm
writing this post. Hopefully it might be useful or interesting to others!

Why?
====
In short, I felt that given a finite lifespan, there were more
fulfilling and enjoyable ways to spend my healthiest weeks than 40+ hours in an
office.

Specifically, there were a few activities I wanted to spend more time doing: cooking, climbing, yoga, and Zen practice.

In review, here are the numbers between then and now:

* hours worked/week: 40-50 => 20
* meals cooked/day: ~0.7 => 2+
* daily Zen practice (zazen): 15 minutes => 70 minutes
* weekly climbing / yoga: 0 => 2
* general exercise: unchanged at 30-60 minutes per day
* monthly income: unchanged!

Overall I'm quite happy with the time I've been able to set aside
for my interests, and feel healthier in body and mind!

How?
====
The first step was quitting my job, of course. Luckily in my case,
issues with my job, combined with having a responsible savings, as well as leads on freelance work, made this decision pretty easy.

Around when I started this adventure, I re-read __The 4-Hour Workweek__ by
Timothy Ferriss. After the first read I applied 
a few of the strategies with success, primarily empowering others to
remove myself as a bottleneck at the workplace, and taking a permanent and
major information diet. Quitting Google Reader alone, I gained hours every week,
plus [a noticeable ability to concentrate again](http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223).

The second time through was very inspiring, and I decided to take his
advice and actually create a short 3-month budget, including not only my
standard living expenses (rent, utilities, food, entertainment), but
also any dreams and goals I wanted to accomplish, some costing money,
but others costing time that I didn't have available until now. The
rationale for doing this is twofold and profound: it forces you to actually spend time
figuring out your goals and hold yourself accountable for
accomplishing them, and it likely shows you that it isn't as expensive
as you thought.

I've already used this "dreamlining" technique to knock out a few things
I'd long had on my to-do list including:

* taking an aerial acrobatics class
* acquiring a proper chef's knife and learning basic knife skills
* learning how to raise hens for eggs and meat via classes
* beginning to learn Polish (I live in Greenpoint)

Even with things on my list including skydiving and and multiple trips
abroad, this exercise pointed out that I could
easily afford them working 20 hours per week. This is possible because:

# they cost less than you think ammortized over 3-6 months
# many goals simply require time, which you'll now have
# you can make more per hour freelancing instead of selling your time
"wholesale"

Downsides to Freelancing
========================

Like most systems that offer great flexibility, you have to do a little
more work yourself that salaried employment handles for you:

* tracking time, invoicing, and following up on checks
* paying for your own healthcare and vacation. These benefits turned out to be much more minor than I thought:
   * healthcare: at 40 hours per week * ~4.3 weeks per month, you can assume you are getting
   a bonus of $1-$3 per hour for healthcare ($172-$516/month).
   * vacation: assuming 5 weeks of vacation/holiday/sick pay out of 52,
     that's about a 10% bonus.

What's next?
============

Working part-time has been incredibly enjoyable, particularly having
entire days off to be out and about during the least crowded and least
expensive times
(weekday afternoons)
instead of the busiest and most expensive (weekends). Looking at my
budget, I should actually be fine working only 10-15 hours per week,
while still saving a reasonable amount per month and allowing for a whopping 10 weeks of vacation per year.
