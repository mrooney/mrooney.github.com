At the end of 2011 I quit my full-time job to pursue part-time freelancing in order to have more time and flexibility. It has now been 6 full months, so in order to evaluate my progress and make improvements, I'm
writing this retrospective post. Hopefully it might be useful or interesting to others!

Why?
====
In short, I felt that given a finite lifespan, there were more
fulfilling and enjoyable ways to spend some of my healthiest weeks than 40+ hours in an
office.

More specifically, there were a few activities I wanted to spend more time doing: cooking, climbing, yoga, and Zen practice.

In review, here are the numbers between then and now:

* hours worked/week: 40-50 => 16-20
* estimated vacation per year: 4 weeks => 12 weeks
* meals cooked/day: ~0.7 => 2+
* daily Zen practice (zazen): 15 minutes => 70 minutes, plus ~1 day a
  week at the Fire Lotus Temple
* weekly climbing / yoga: 0 => 2
* monthly income: unchanged!

Overall I'm quite happy with the time I've been able to set aside
for my interests, and feel healthier in body and mind!

How?
====
The first step was quitting my job, of course. Luckily in my case,
issues with my job, combined with having a responsible savings and leads on freelance work made this decision pretty easy. Curiously enough, I'm pretty sure reading Fahrenheit 451 put the final nail in the coffin.

Once you're free, I found that the two initial problems you are likely to run into with part-time
freelancing are money and time.
That is, budgeting for inconsistent and unpredictable income, and not squandering your
free time or becoming bored and falling into unnecessary work. There's also the issue of finding
freelancing jobs and maintaining a pipeline, but since that's more
specific to whatever you skill is, I won't touch on that here.

Let's tackle the money and time issues separately.

Money
-----
My favorite freelance budgeting technique has been to treat your freelancing
as a business: deposit your checks into a separate account, set aside
taxes, and then pay yourself a fixed amount monthly from this account. This way, if you
don't work for a period of time or want to take vacation, it is very
clear how much money is remaining in your freelancing account. For
example, if you have $9,000 in your freelance account, and are paying yourself
$3,000/month (taxes are already taken out), you can go 3 months without another job if
necessary or desired.

The first part of this is easy. Open a separate checking or savings
account (this took about 30 seconds as an ING customer), deposit your
freelance checks into this account, then transfer out your estimated tax
withholding. For example, if you receive a check for $5,000 and you pay a 30%
tax rate, deposit the check in your freelance account and transfer out
$1,500 elsewhere for later tax payment, or alternately deposit the whole
check wherever is easiest and transfer $3,500 to your freelance account.

Next, figure out your monthly budget. I'll leave this to you, but
mine included rent, utilities, health insurance, Roth IRA contributions,
transportation, groceries, eating out, subscription services, and
memberships. You'll likely want to
multiply this number by ~1.3 to get a padding for savings and unexpected costs.

Once you've done this for a few months and have a padding in your freelance account, you
can even set up a recurring transfer for this amount on the first of each month from your
freelance account to your personal checking.

Time

Because our culture so heavily emphasizes work and particularly having a full-time job for most of your life, unless you consciously and constantly evaluate how _you_ want to spend your time, you'll likely find yourself working more hours, regardless of necessity. Ferriss calls this "work for work's sake", and we want to avoid falling into this trap, instead finding fulfilling activities done for their own sake.

The aforementioned budgeting technique helps us out nicely with this, allowing us to clearly see if we actually need to be working, based on the balance of the freelance account. For example, you might say that 3 months of padding is sufficient security for you, and once you complete any job that lands you at a balance over that amount, you'll take off until you hit that threshold again.

So once you figure out your work cap, you have to use your free time wisely. And as importantly, how not to use your time. A couple years ago I started a permanent information diet; quitting Google Reader alone I gained hours every week,
plus [a noticeable ability to concentrate again](http://www.amazon.com/The-Shallows-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393072223). At first going to Reader/Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr were such mindless distractions for me that I had to block my access to them or I'd end up on them without realizing it, but after a few months those habits faded. I also found the same thing with TV shows and computer games, and made sure to be conscious of when a show felt like a chore to catch up on and stop watching it, or when a game felt grindy and uninstall it. Now I just watch about 2 shows a week, and ended up completely uninstalling Steam and my Windows partition as I was never using them.

Additionally, I made a list of everything I wanted to do, including recurring
and one-time events. The previously mentioned activities such as cooking,
climbing, yoga, reading, and Zen filled in most of the time nicely so
there was little opportunity for boredom, but
I also knocked out a few things
I'd long had on my to-do list including:

* taking an aerial acrobatics class
* acquiring a proper chef's knife and taking a knife skills class
* learning how to raise hens for eggs and meat
* beginning to learn Polish (I live in [Greenpoint, Brooklyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenpoint,_Brooklyn))

I also took the entire month of June off and spent it visiting friends
and family, some I haven't seen in years. I ended up in York, Rochester, Austin, San Francisco, as well as upstate NYC for a
week of camping with my girlfriend and her parents. I've also been
able to host family and friends visiting NYC on weekdays that I wouldn't have
otherwise been able to spend time with.

Downsides to Freelancing
========================

Okay, clearly I'm pretty happy freelancing, but like most systems that offer great flexibility, you have to do a little
more work yourself that salaried employment handles for you:

* finding opportunities and turning them into contracts
* tracking time, invoicing, and following up on checks
* paying for your own healthcare and vacation. These benefits turned out to be much more minor than I thought:
   * healthcare: at 40 hours per week * ~4.3 weeks per month, you can assume you are getting
   a bonus of $1-$3 per hour for healthcare ($172-$516/month).
   * vacation: assuming 5 weeks of vacation/holiday/sick pay out of 52,
     that's about a 10% bonus.

So in other words, a $100K salary which corresponds to roughly $50/hour
requires a freelancing rate of $56-58/hour to pay for healthcare and
time off. I had no problem
doubling my previous rate as just a starting point, so this was easily
made up for and is what allowed me to dramatically cut hours without a
pay cut.

What's next?
============

Working part-time has been incredibly enjoyable, particularly having
entire days off to be out and about during the least crowded and least
expensive times (weekday afternoons)
instead of the busiest and most expensive (weekends). As long as I can
keep my pipeline full (and it looks like I'm set into 2013 at the
moment), I'd love to keep shooting for about 16 hours per week, taking a
month off after every three working.

I'd love to hear about your experiences in your work life, or any
questions or thoughts you want to share!
